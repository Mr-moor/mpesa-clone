THE LAYOUT 
The project has been written using c/c++ and with the compliment of sqlite,which serves as a database for storing transactions and data N/B THE FORM IN WHICH THE TRANSACTIONS ARE COMMITED IS NOT SECURE you may decide to use secure methods due to security please when writing programs for financial institutions follow the ACID rule.
the main program is sandwhitched in a switch statement and mutually binded with control structures (IF,IF THEN ELSE,ETC),data structures[arrays]

HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS 
The first function of the code is to allow the admin to create password and username,which must contain an upper case,lower case letter,number and special characters,if not a prompt "invalid password,password must contain..." is displayed.
The password is then encrypted using a special key generated by HASH256 and SALT algorithm and then saved on a TXT FILE which when the user/admin tries to login,its called decrypted and checked if it matches with the recently entered password and username by the admin/user.
The program then displays the content using showMenu() where the latter starts from 0-8
